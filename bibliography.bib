abstract = {InfiniBand is an emerging HPC interconnect being deployed in very large scale clusters, with even larger InfiniBand-based clusters expected to be deployed in the near future. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the programming model of choice for scientific applications running on these largescale clusters. Thus, it is very critical for the MPI implementation used to be based on a scalable and high-performance design. We analyze the performance and scalability aspects of MVAPICH, a popular open-source MPI implementation on InfiniBand, from an application standpoint. We analyze the performance and memory requirements of the MPI library while executing several well-known applications and benchmarks, such as NAS, SuperLU, NAMD, and HPL on a 64-node InfiniBand cluster. Our analysis reveals that latest design of MVAPICH requires an order of magnitude less internal MPI memory (average per process) and yet delivers the best possible performance. Further, we observe that for these benchmarks and applications evaluated, the internal memory requirement of MVAPICH remains nearly constant at around 5-10 MB as the number of processes increase, indicating that the MVAPICH design is highly scalable.},

Analysis of single-channel recordings performed with different divalent cations present at 55 mM on the trans (intraluminal) side of the membrane revealed that the current amplitude at 0 mV and the single-channel slope conductance fell in the sequence: Ba (2.2 pA, 85 pS) \\&gt; Sr (2.0 pA, 77 pS) \\&gt; Ca (1.4 pA, 53 pS) \\&gt; Mg (1.1 pA, 42 pS). The mean open time of the InsP3R recorded with Ca (2.9 ms) was significantly shorter than with other divalent cations (approximately 5.5 ms). The "anomalous mole fraction effect" was not observed in mixtures of divalent cations (Mg and Ba), suggesting that these channels are single-ion pores. Measurements of InsP3R activity at different intraluminal Ca levels demonstrated that Ca in the submillimolar range did not potentiate channel activity, and that very high levels of intraluminal Ca (\\&gt; or = 10 mM) decreased channel open probability 5-10-fold. When InsP3R were measured with Ba as a current carrier in the presence of 110 mM cis potassium, a PBa/PK of 6.3 was estimated from the extrapolated value for the reversal potential. When the unitary current through the InsP3R at 0 mV was measured as a function of the permeant ion (Ba) concentration, the half-maximal current occurred at 10 mM trans Ba. The following conclusions are drawn from these data: (a) the conduction properties of InsP3R are similar to the properties of the ryanodine receptor, another intracellular Ca channel, and differ dramatically from the properties of voltage-gated Ca channels of the plasma membrane. (b) The estimated size of the Ca current through the InsP3R under physiological conditions is 0.5 pA, approximately four times less than the Ca current through the ryanodine receptor. (c) The potentiation of InsP3R by intraluminal Ca in the submillimolar range remains controversial. (d) A quantitative model that explains the inhibitory effects of high trans Ca on InsP3R activity was developed and the kinetic parameters of InsP3R gating were determined.}",

In combination with Ca(2+)-ATPase activity for Ca2+ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum, the model leads to cytoplasmic oscillations in Ca2+ concentration at fixed IP3 concentration and only a single pool of releasable Ca2+, the endoplasmic reticulum. Incorporation of a positive-feedback mechanism of Ca2+ on IP3 production by phospholipase C enriches the properties of the oscillations and leads to oscillations in Ca2+ concentration accompanied by oscillations in IP3 concentration.

ABSTRACT={The morphology of neurons and networks plays an important role in processing electrical and biochemical signals. Based on neuronal reconstructions, which are becoming abundantly available through databases such as NeuroMorpho.org, numerical simulations of Hodgkin-Huxley-type equations, coupled to biochemical models, can be performed in order to systematically investigate the influence of cellular morphology and the connectivity pattern in networks on the underlying function. Development in the area of synthetic neural network generation and morphology reconstruction from microscopy data has brought forth the software tool NeuGen. Coupling this morphology data (either from databases, synthetic, or reconstruction) to the simulation platform UG 4 (which harbors a neuroscientific portfolio) and VRL-Studio, has brought forth the extendible toolbox NeuroBox. NeuroBox allows users to perform numerical simulations on hybrid-dimensional morphology representations. The code basis is designed in a modular way, such that e.g., new channel or synapse types can be added to the library. Workflows can be specified through scripts or through the VRL-Studio graphical workflow representation. Third-party tools, such as ImageJ, can be added to NeuroBox workflows. In this paper, NeuroBox is used to study the electrical and biochemical effects of synapse loss vs. synchrony in neurons, to investigate large morphology data sets within detailed biophysical simulations, and used to demonstrate the capability of utilizing high-performance computing infrastructure for large scale network simulations. Using new synapse distribution methods and Finite Volume based numerical solvers for compartment-type models, our results demonstrate how an increase in synaptic synchronization can compensate synapse loss at the electrical and calcium level, and how detailed neuronal morphology can be integrated in large-scale network simulations.}

abstract = {Background
Calcium (Ca2+) oscillations are ubiquitous signals present in all cells that provide efficient means to transmit intracellular biological information. Either spontaneously or upon receptor ligand binding, the otherwise stable cytosolic Ca2+ concentration starts to oscillate. The resulting specific oscillatory pattern is interpreted by intracellular downstream effectors that subsequently activate different cellular processes. This signal transduction can occur through frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM), much similar to a radio signal. The decoding of the oscillatory signal is typically performed by enzymes with multiple Ca2+ binding residues that diversely can regulate its total phosphorylation, thereby activating cellular program. To date, NFAT, NF-κB, CaMKII, MAPK and calpain have been reported to have frequency decoding properties.
Scope of review
The basic principles and recent discoveries reporting frequency decoding of FM Ca2+ oscillations are reviewed here.
Major conclusions
A limited number of cellular frequency decoding molecules of Ca2+ oscillations have yet been reported. Interestingly, their responsiveness to Ca2+ oscillatory frequencies shows little overlap, suggesting their specific roles in cells.
General significance
Frequency modulation of Ca2+ oscillations provides an efficient means to differentiate biological responses in the cell, both in health and in disease. Thus, it is crucial to identify and characterize all cellular frequency decoding molecules to understand how cells control important cell programs.}

The present work was aimed at reproducing a prolonged exposure to low concentrations of paraoxon and assessing possible damage to the hippocampus during the period of most significant cholinergic development. Male Wistar rats were given, from P8 to P20, subcutaneous daily injections of paraoxon (0.1, 0.15 and 0.2mg/kg). The rate of body weight gain was reduced by all doses of paraoxon and brain ChE activity progressively decreased up to 60\% by P21. Some deaths occurred in the beginning of the treatment, but the surviving animals showed neither convulsions nor overt signs of cholinergic hyperstimulation. Morphometric analysis of Lucifer Yellow-stained CA1 pyramidal neurons in coronal sections of the hippocampus showed that by P21 paraoxon caused a decrease in spine density on basal but not on secondary apical dendrites. The dendritic arborization and the pyramidal and granular cell body layers were not altered by paraoxon. ChE staining decreased in all hippocampal and dentate gyrus regions studied, whereas choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and zinc-positive fibers remained as in control. In summary, chronic exposure to low paraoxon concentrations during the period of rapid brain development caused significant and selective decrease in basal dendritic spine density of the CA1 pyramidal neurons. Distinct modulation of the basal tree at the stratum oriens by the interplay of cholinergic afferent and GABAergic interneurons, as well as the remodeling process in response to a repetitive and rather mild paraoxon insult, may account for this selective susceptibility of basal dendritic spines. The hippocampal alterations described here occurred in the absence of toxic cholinergic signs and may affect brain development and cause functional deficits that could continue into adulthood.}

	abstract = {Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique widely used in research and clinical applications. However, its mechanism of action and the neural response to TMS are still poorly understood. Multi-scale modeling can complement experimental research and provide a framework between the physical input parameters and the subcellular neural effects of TMS. At the macroscopic level, sophisticated numerical models exist to estimate the induced electric fields in whole-brain volume conductor models. However, multi-scale computational modeling approaches to predict TMS cellular and subcellular responses, crucial to understanding TMS plasticity inducing protocols, are not available so far. Here, we develop a multi-scale Neuron Modeling for TMS toolbox (NeMo-TMS) that enables researchers to easily generate accurate neuron models from morphological reconstructions, couple them to the external electric fields induced by TMS, and to simulate the cellular and subcellular responses of the neurons. Both single-pulse and rTMS protocols can be simulated and results visualized in 3D. We openly share our toolbox and provide example scripts and datasets for the user to explore. NeMo-TMS toolbox (https://github.com/OpitzLab/NeMo-TMS) allows researchers a previously not available level of detail and precision in realistically modeling the physical and physiological effects of TMS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
